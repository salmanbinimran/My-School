        Comilla Zilla School's past-glorious present is admirable. Comilla District School was established on 20th July 1837 by Mr. Henry George Leicester, the then Principal of the Local Magistrate's Office. It was then known as Comilla Government School. Its management was entrusted to a committee of 5 Europeans, 1 Hindu and 3 Muslim intellectuals. This school was started to educate the people of this country in English education. 1839 English 6th May m: Appointed Headmaster of Leicester School. He worked in the said position till his death (1870).
        
        
        
        Its first class started in a bungalow on the banks of the mighty lake known as 'Dharmasagar'. Later, old type of paved buildings were built in that place. The school, run by four teachers including the headmaster, had only 35 students. There were no examinations in the first year of the school and no salary was charged to students until 1839 English. In that year, the number of students stood at 76. Gradually the number of students increased. In 1863 the total number of students was 213 including 33 Muslims. The school then had a number of Mughal and Indian Christian students.
        
        
        
        The main aim of the school was to prepare students for the Junior Scholarship Examination. Mr. Leicester deserves credit for that. 1854 Government policy on education in English changed. The burden of education is left to the Department of Public Education. Due to the increase in the number of students, one more class was introduced. The teaching staff consisted of a head teacher, 5 English teachers, a mother tongue scholar and a cleric. The head teacher used to get Rs.200 per month and others from Rs.20 to Rs.60 per month.
        
        
        
        1863 A training section for scholars was opened in English school and two classes were started for this purpose. However, it was moved to Chittagong in 1869. When the University of Calcutta was established in 1857, the entrance examination was introduced in place of the Junior Scholarship Examination. At that time the school received a one-time aid of Tk 4932. In 1870, the school received a total of 5330 rupees five annas for student salary and government aid. The Maharaja of Tripura and the local zamindars were interested in the school at that time. Maharaja used to give two scholarships and Raja Satya Charan Ghosal gave one scholarship each year for the students.
        
        
        
        Babu Umacharan Das, Babu Hariprasad Banerjee, Babu Jagabandhu Bhadra, Babu Dwijdas Dutta and Mr. William Dutta were the Headmasters of the school from 1871 to 1558 respectively. The interest of the general public in education is gradually increasing. In the latter part of 1883 the number of students was 404. At that time the number of Muslim students was 70 out of 60. The increase in the number of students necessitated the expansion of the school building. At this time 4 new rooms were built.
        
        
        
        At that time, the school received 800 taka per year from the Muhsin Fund. From it, the salary of a Persian teacher, scholarships for meritorious students and help for those Muslim students who were unable to pay the salary were given. Over time the inclination towards sports increased. As a result, a physical education teacher was appointed in 1885.
        
        
        
        Babu Kailash Chandra Bhattacharya, Surya Kumar Roy and Babu Chinta Haran Chakraborty who worked with great devotion and ability from 1558 to 1907. During their tenure, the school improved in many ways. 1901 'E' class opened in English with 4 students. Inquiry teaching was the aim of this class. A dhahabhi was constructed at a cost of Rs 4125 to replace it. A drawing teacher was appointed in 1896 and a science teacher in 1902.
        
        
        
        The entrance exam results have always been good. A student stood 2nd in University in 1900 and 8th in 1901. Babu Ram Mohan Mitra, Babu Abhay Charan Das, Babu Sarat Chandra Bose and Khan Saheb Wahidun Nabi were the head teachers for the next two years. Babu Sarat Chandra Bose was killed by some miscreants on his way home on March 3, 1915 at five o'clock in the afternoon. It is a very unfortunate thing in the history of the school. In 1913 the student salary in the school was one rupee eight annas to three rupees. 1st and 2nd classes were abolished in 1909, 3rd class in 1917 and 4th class in 1962.
        
        
        
        In 1911 Hindu hostel was built for 44 students. Its management is left to a teacher. He used to earn twenty rupees a month. Due to the increase in the number of students, two years later an English teacher and an Arabic teacher were appointed. The number of teachers was 19 including 5 Muslims. A tin shed was built that year at a cost of 758 rupees. In 1919, a teacher was given a monthly allowance of Rs 20 for managing the school library.
        
        
        
        The first scout troop was formed in the school in 1920 with the interest of a drill teacher named Babu Rasik Charan Bose. During the next two decades, the leaders of the school were Roy Saheb Jyotish Mukherjee, Babu Upendra Chandra Graha and Maulvi Abdul Mannan Saheb. That time was very important for the school. The air of Bengal was filled with non-cooperation movement. The school overcame that situation successfully.
        
        
        
        The number of books in the school library keeps increasing. Due to retrenchment by the Bengal government, the allowance for books was reduced to one hundred rupees and the post of librarian was abolished in 1933. The prayer house which was built in 1910, seventy years later its walls and walls were paved with the initiative of Maud Md. Faiz Sahib. Mr. J.M. When Botamoli was Director of Public Education, a two-storied building on the north side of the grounds was planned and Sarakārēra nikaṭa dākhila karā haẏēchila. 1969 Iṁ ai plyāna bāstabāẏanēra kāja śēṣa haẏēchē. 1936 Inrējītē bidyālaẏē yām̐rā śikṣaka chilēna-
